# Mbot 
is a robot that moves with a differential
drive, two parallel wheels with a rear caster. Each
motor is equipped with a magnetic wheel encoder. The
robot also has a scanning 2D Lidar, a Raspberry Pi
camera, and a MEMS 3-axis IMU. The MBot has a Wi-
Fi module, which we use to SSH into and program the
onboard Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi) computer module. The
low-level motor control is handled on a Raspberry Pico
